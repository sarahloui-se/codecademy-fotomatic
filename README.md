# Codecademy Off-Platform Project: Fotomatic
A complete overhaul of the HTML & CSS, resulting in a fully responsive, mobile first site that could be converted with minimal effort into a theme for a CMS.

## Rationale
* Number of validation errors in supplied HTML
* CSS had multiple media queries spread throughout `style.css`
* Noticed several sections essentially had the same design pattern

## Coding Process
To list later.

## To-Do List
* CSS: clean up classes & IDs based on updated HTML
* CSS: group media queries to end of style.css
* HTML: go through non-sectioning comments & address
* Draw up clean wireframes to include in this file
* README.md: Expand dotpoints for full sentences
